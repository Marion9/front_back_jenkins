# front_back_jenkins

Due to connections problems, I did not have the time to end the tp. Moreover, I could not check that the link between github and Jenkins was really working. Meanwhile, it was running alone on Docker and I use the same first command in the Jenkinsfile as last time and it worked well so I assume that was working too.
